# NOTE: by default homebrew does not compile emacs with os x
# specific options, the standard emacs is missing the following:
# toolbar-mode are not functions and will error during init
# sqlplus mode uses an image format that is not supported
# ctrl-arrow keys do not work properly

# This does appear to work:
# brew install emacs --cocoa --srbg
# However, if emacs is already installed brew will not re-install
# it and its not easy to determine if it was installed correctly
# whereas it is easy to determine if emacsformacosx is already
# installed correctly.
